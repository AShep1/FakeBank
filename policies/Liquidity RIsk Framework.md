# Liquidity Risk Framework

Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 2025-10-01

## Purpose
Set the Bank's policy for managing liquidity risk using measurable metrics derived from the FakeBank dataset. The framework provides limit definitions, aggregation/measurement rules and escalation steps so limit breaches are actionable.

## Scope & Data Sources
Primary tables:
- `data/liquidity_positions.parquet`: `position_id`, `as_of_date`, `currency`, `amount`, `geography`, `maturity_bucket`
- `data/funding_sources.parquet`: `funding_id`, `source_type`, `amount`, `as_of_date`
- `data/liquidity_metrics.parquet`: `LCR`, `NSFR`, `cash_inflows`, `cash_outflows`, `as_of_date`

## Limit Framework (metrication & aggregation rules)

- Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR):
  - Metric: HQLA / net_cash_outflows_30d, measured monthly at each `as_of_date` using `liquidity_metrics`.
  - Appetite: Minimum 110% (Green); Amber 100%-110% (management action); Red <100% (Board escalation).

- Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR):
  - Metric: available_stable_funding / required_stable_funding (use `liquidity_metrics` or constructed from `funding_sources` & `liquidity_positions`).
  - Appetite: Minimum 105% (Green); Amber 100%-105%; Red <100%.

- Funding concentration:
  - Metric: funding_share = sum(amount) by `source_type` / total_funding at `as_of_date`.
  - Appetite: single source <= 20% of total funding. Alert at 18%.

- Maturity mismatch / survival horizon:
  - Metric: cumulative net outflows by maturity bucket (0-7d, 8-30d, 31-90d, >90d).
  - Appetite: sufficient HQLA to cover 30-day net outflows under severe stress scenarios.

## Monitoring, Reporting & Frequency
- Frequency: Monthly snapshots (per `as_of_date`) with simulated intraday EWI thresholds when LCR < 115%.
- Required reports:
  - LCR and NSFR time series and drivers by `as_of_date`.
  - Top funding sources and concentration analysis by `source_type` and `geography`.
  - Maturity ladder and projected net cash flow for the next 90 days.
- Owners: Head of Treasury (operational), CRO (oversight), Risk Analytics (calculations).

## Escalation & Response (Actions & Timelines)
- Amber condition (e.g., LCR 100%-110% or funding concentration 18%-20%):
  - Notify: Head of Treasury, CRO, Risk Analytics within 2 business days.
  - Actions: deliver funding plan within 10 business days; reprioritise HQLA; reduce non-essential liquidity usage.

- Red condition (e.g., LCR <100% or NSFR <100%):
  - Notify: CRO, CFO, CEO and Board Risk Committee immediately (within 1 business day).
  - Actions: immediate contingency funding measures (draw repo lines, central bank facilities), restrict all discretionary lending; produce a 7-day survival plan.

## Stress Testing
- Required scenarios: idiosyncratic funding shock (withdrawal of largest funding source), market shock (margin calls from market positions) and combined shocks.
- Measure survival days: run deterministic withdrawal scenarios and report number of days before HQLA exhausted.

## Data Quality & Reconciliation
- Mandatory fields: `as_of_date`, `amount`, `maturity_bucket`, `source_type`, `LCR`, `NSFR`.
- Reconciliation: sum(liquidity_positions.amount) should reconcile to sum(funding_sources.amount) plus net deposit movement derived from loans/write-offs; tolerance 1%.

# Liquidity Risk Framework

Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 2025-10-01

## Purpose
Ensure the Bank maintains sufficient liquidity under normal and stressed conditions. This framework maps policy metrics to liquidity tables generated by the FakeBank data generator.

## Scope
Primary sources:
- `data/liquidity_positions.parquet` (fields: `position_id`, `as_of_date`, `currency`, `amount`, `geography`, `maturity_bucket`)
- `data/funding_sources.parquet` (fields: `funding_id`, `source_type`, `amount`, `as_of_date`)
- `data/liquidity_metrics.parquet` (fields: `LCR`, `NSFR`, `cash_inflows`, `cash_outflows`, `as_of_date`)

## Key Metrics & Limits
- Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) — minimum 110% (measure monthly at `as_of_date`).
- Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) — minimum 105% (measure monthly).
- Maximum single funding source: <= 20% of total funding (alert at 18%).
- Stress outflow coverage: hold HQLA to cover 30 days of net outflows in a severe stress scenario.

## Concentration & Diversification Rules
- Compute funding concentration = funding_source_amount / total_funding by `as_of_date` and `source_type`; require <=20%.
- Currency mismatches: flag currency-specific funding gaps > 10% of position in that currency.

## Cash Flow Forecasting & Maturity Management
- Aggregate `liquidity_positions` into standard maturity buckets (0-7d, 8-30d, 31-90d, >90d) and compute net funding requirement by bucket.
- Run 30-, 60-, 90-day cashflow forecasts and identify liquidity gaps.

## Monitoring & Reporting
- Frequency: Monthly formal reporting, with intraday early-warning alerts simulated where LCR < 115%.
- Reports:
  - LCR/NSFR time series and trend by `as_of_date`.
  - Top funding sources and concentration metrics.
  - Projected net cash flow by geography and currency for next 90 days.

## Stress Testing
- Idiosyncratic funding shock: remove top funding source (simulate 50% reduction) and measure survival days.
- Market shock: use `market_positions` P&L shocks to simulate collateral calls and margin outflows.

## Escalation & Remediation
- Amber: LCR between 100%-110% — prepare funding plan within 10 business days.
- Red: LCR < 100% or NSFR < 100% — immediate funding actions, escalate to CFO/CRO and Board notification.

## Data Quality Requirements
- Mandatory fields: `as_of_date`, `amount`, `maturity_bucket`, `source_type`, `LCR`, `NSFR`.
- Monthly reconciliations: total liquidity_positions.amount should reconcile to funding_sources and net deposit movement derived from `loans` and `write_offs`.

# Liquidity Risk Framework

Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 2025-10-01

## Purpose
Define monitoring, limits and governance for liquidity risk using the synthetic liquidity dataset. The framework maps to `specs/liquidity_risk.md` and `data/liquidity_*.parquet` outputs.

## Scope and Primary Data Sources
- `data/liquidity_positions.parquet` (fields: `position_id`, `as_of_date`, `currency`, `amount`, `geography`, `maturity_bucket`)
- `data/funding_sources.parquet` (fields: `funding_id`, `source_type`, `amount`, `as_of_date`)
- `data/liquidity_metrics.parquet` (fields: `LCR`, `NSFR`, `cash_inflows`, `cash_outflows`, `as_of_date`)

## Key Metrics and Limits
- Minimum LCR: 110% — measure at each `as_of_date` and report monthly.
- Minimum NSFR: 105% — measure at each `as_of_date` and report monthly.
- Maximum single funding source: 20% of total funding — compute by aggregating `funding_sources.amount` by `source_type`.
- Stress scenario outflow coverage: the bank must hold sufficient HQLA to cover 30 days of net outflows as per synthetic stress profiles.

## Concentration and Diversification
- Monitor funding concentration by `source_type` and `geography` — flag if any single bucket >20% of total funding.
- Monitor currency mismatches in `liquidity_positions` and require FX hedging or matched funding for material balances.

## Cash Flow Forecasting and Maturity Mismatch
- Project monthly cash flows using `liquidity_positions.maturity_bucket` and `funding_sources` to identify maturity mismatches.
- Run 30-, 60-, and 90-day liquidity stress tests using time series across `as_of_date`.

## Monitoring and Reporting
- Frequency: Monthly formally, intraday/weekly for key metrics in production environments (in synthetic data use monthly snapshots).
- Reports:
  - LCR and NSFR time series by `as_of_date`.
  - Top 10 funding sources by amount and concentration percentages.
  - Projected net cash flow for next 90 days by `geography` and `currency`.

## Escalation and Remediation
- Amber breach (LCR 100% - 110%): prepare funding plan within 10 business days and reduce non-essential liquidity usage.
- Red breach (LCR < 100% or NSFR < 100%): immediate funding actions and escalation to CFO/CRO; notify Board.

## Stress Testing and Scenario Design
- Apply idiosyncratic funding shock: withdrawal of top funding source (simulate reduction by 50%) and measure days of coverage.
- Market shock: simultaneous 20% adverse move in market positions causing collateral calls (use `market_positions` to parameterize margin impacts).

## Data Quality and Governance
- Mandatory fields: `as_of_date`, `amount`, `maturity_bucket`, `source_type`, `LCR`, `NSFR`.
- Monthly reconciliations: verify that sum(liquidity_positions.amount) == sum(funding_sources.amount) + net deposits movement derived from loans and write-offs.

Liquidity Risk Framework
1. Purpose

To ensure the bank maintains adequate liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses.

2. Key Objectives

Maintain regulatory compliance with APRA’s LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) and NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio) requirements.

Preserve market confidence by ensuring the bank can meet obligations under stress.

Minimise liquidity cost while optimising asset–liability mix.

Support business strategy without taking excessive funding risk.

3. Governance
Level	Responsibilities
Board / Risk Committee	Approve liquidity risk appetite, review reports, approve contingency funding plan
ALCO (Asset-Liability Committee)	Set liquidity buffers, funding strategy, review stress test outcomes
Treasury	Manage day-to-day liquidity, maintain funding sources, execute contingency plan
Risk Management	Independent monitoring, policy setting, stress testing, reporting to Board
4. Liquidity Risk Appetite

Survival Horizon: Maintain sufficient liquidity buffer to withstand 30 days of severe stress (minimum regulatory).

Buffer Size: Hold High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) sufficient for regulatory LCR + internal overlay (e.g., 10%).

Funding Mix: Set concentration limits by:

Counterparty (no more than X% from any one funder)

Product type (e.g., wholesale vs. retail deposits)

Currency (if multi-currency operations)

Early Warning Indicators: Monitor metrics like deposit outflows, cost of funds, and market access.

5. Measurement
Metric	Definition	Purpose
LCR	HQLA / Net cash outflows over 30 days	Regulatory minimum ≥ 100%
NSFR	Available stable funding / Required stable funding	Regulatory minimum ≥ 100%
Liquidity Gap Analysis	Cash inflows/outflows by time bucket	Identify mismatches
Survival Horizon	Days until cash buffer runs out under stress	Internal risk appetite
Concentration Metrics	% of funding from largest 5 sources	Detect funding concentration risk
6. Stress Testing

Run regular liquidity stress scenarios:

Idiosyncratic Stress: Bank-specific reputational or credit event (e.g., rating downgrade).

Market-wide Stress: Reduced market liquidity, spike in wholesale funding cost.

Combined Stress: Simultaneous bank-specific and market-wide shocks.

Test different horizons: 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days.

Model customer deposit outflows, secured funding haircuts, drawdowns on committed lines.

7. Funding Strategy

Diversification: Maintain mix of retail, wholesale, and central bank eligible collateral.

Maturity Ladder: Avoid excessive short-term funding reliance.

Contingent Funding Sources: Maintain access to repo markets, central bank facilities, internal liquidity buffers.

8. Contingency Funding Plan (CFP)

Key elements:

Triggers: Breach of early warning indicators, rating downgrade, sudden deposit withdrawals.

Actions: Increase HQLA, raise funding, slow lending growth, draw central bank lines.

Communication Plan: Inform ALCO, Board, regulators, rating agencies as needed.
