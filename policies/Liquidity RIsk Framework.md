Liquidity Risk Framework
1. Purpose

To ensure the bank maintains adequate liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses.

2. Key Objectives

Maintain regulatory compliance with APRA’s LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) and NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio) requirements.

Preserve market confidence by ensuring the bank can meet obligations under stress.

Minimise liquidity cost while optimising asset–liability mix.

Support business strategy without taking excessive funding risk.

3. Governance
Level	Responsibilities
Board / Risk Committee	Approve liquidity risk appetite, review reports, approve contingency funding plan
ALCO (Asset-Liability Committee)	Set liquidity buffers, funding strategy, review stress test outcomes
Treasury	Manage day-to-day liquidity, maintain funding sources, execute contingency plan
Risk Management	Independent monitoring, policy setting, stress testing, reporting to Board
4. Liquidity Risk Appetite

Survival Horizon: Maintain sufficient liquidity buffer to withstand 30 days of severe stress (minimum regulatory).

Buffer Size: Hold High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) sufficient for regulatory LCR + internal overlay (e.g., 10%).

Funding Mix: Set concentration limits by:

Counterparty (no more than X% from any one funder)

Product type (e.g., wholesale vs. retail deposits)

Currency (if multi-currency operations)

Early Warning Indicators: Monitor metrics like deposit outflows, cost of funds, and market access.

5. Measurement
Metric	Definition	Purpose
LCR	HQLA / Net cash outflows over 30 days	Regulatory minimum ≥ 100%
NSFR	Available stable funding / Required stable funding	Regulatory minimum ≥ 100%
Liquidity Gap Analysis	Cash inflows/outflows by time bucket	Identify mismatches
Survival Horizon	Days until cash buffer runs out under stress	Internal risk appetite
Concentration Metrics	% of funding from largest 5 sources	Detect funding concentration risk
6. Stress Testing

Run regular liquidity stress scenarios:

Idiosyncratic Stress: Bank-specific reputational or credit event (e.g., rating downgrade).

Market-wide Stress: Reduced market liquidity, spike in wholesale funding cost.

Combined Stress: Simultaneous bank-specific and market-wide shocks.

Test different horizons: 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days.

Model customer deposit outflows, secured funding haircuts, drawdowns on committed lines.

7. Funding Strategy

Diversification: Maintain mix of retail, wholesale, and central bank eligible collateral.

Maturity Ladder: Avoid excessive short-term funding reliance.

Contingent Funding Sources: Maintain access to repo markets, central bank facilities, internal liquidity buffers.

8. Contingency Funding Plan (CFP)

Key elements:

Triggers: Breach of early warning indicators, rating downgrade, sudden deposit withdrawals.

Actions: Increase HQLA, raise funding, slow lending growth, draw central bank lines.

Communication Plan: Inform ALCO, Board, regulators, rating agencies as needed.
