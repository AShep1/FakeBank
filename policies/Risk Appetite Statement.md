# Risk Appetite Statement

Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 2025-10-01

## Overview
This Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) expresses the Bankâ€™s measurable appetite for risk across key dimensions and ties each appetite metric to explicit dataset computations so that breaches are detectible and auditable.

## High-level Appetite Metrics (measurable KPIs)
- Capital: CAR (monthly) Target >=12%, Minimum 10.5%.
- Credit quality: average credit rating (EAD-weighted) Target B or better (avg_score <= 2).
- Provision coverage: >= 1.5% of loan book.
- Liquidity: LCR >= 110%, NSFR >= 105%.
- Market risk: Desk VaR <= AUD 10M; position concentration <= 10% per instrument.
- Concentration metrics: Single customer exposure <= 5% of Capital_total; single funding source <= 20% of funding.

## Appetite by Dimension & Aggregation Rules
- Credit: limits by `industry` and `geography` measured as EAD share of total EAD (soft industry cap 15%, hard cap 20%).
- Liquidity: funding concentration measured as funding source amount / total funding (limit 20%).
- Market: instrument concentration measured as instrument market_value / total desk market_value (limit 10%).

## Monitoring, Escalation & Governance
- Frequency: Monthly (per `as_of_date`) with ad-hoc simulated intraday alerts for early-warning thresholds.
- Any Red breach must be reported to CRO and Board within 24 hours; remediation plan due within 5 business days.

## Review Cycle
- Annual review of RAS or after material changes to business strategy or stress exercises.
