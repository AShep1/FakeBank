Capital Adequacy Framework
1. Purpose

Ensure the bank maintains sufficient capital to absorb unexpected losses and continue operating under stress, in line with regulatory requirements and the bank’s risk appetite.

2. Key Objectives

Regulatory Compliance: Meet or exceed APRA minimum capital requirements (CET1, Tier 1, Total Capital).

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment: Hold capital consistent with the bank’s risk profile and strategic plan (ICAAP).

Support Growth: Ensure capital is sufficient to fund new lending, trading activity, and business expansion.

Market Confidence: Maintain capital ratios that reassure depositors, counterparties, and rating agencies.

3. Governance
Level	Responsibilities
Board / Risk Committee	Approves capital risk appetite, ICAAP, recovery plan
ALCO / Capital Committee	Reviews capital position, sets buffers, allocates capital
Risk Management	Independent measurement of RWA, stress testing, capital attribution
Finance / Treasury	Manages capital instruments, dividend policy, capital issuance
Internal Audit	Provides assurance over capital adequacy process
4. Regulatory Capital Components
Capital Type	Composition	Purpose
CET1 (Common Equity Tier 1)	Ordinary shares, retained earnings	Primary loss-absorbing capital
Tier 1 Capital	CET1 + Additional Tier 1 instruments (hybrid capital)	Going-concern capital
Total Capital	Tier 1 + Tier 2 instruments (subordinated debt)	Includes gone-concern capital
5. Key Ratios & Minimums
Ratio	Formula	Regulatory Minimum (APRA)
CET1 Ratio	CET1 Capital ÷ RWA	4.5% + capital conservation buffer (typically 10.25% effective minimum for major banks)
Tier 1 Ratio	Tier 1 Capital ÷ RWA	6.0%
Total Capital Ratio	Total Capital ÷ RWA	8.0%
Leverage Ratio	Tier 1 Capital ÷ Total Exposures	≥ 3%

Banks typically hold buffers above minimums to absorb volatility and meet market expectations.

6. Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)

Capital adequacy depends on RWA, calculated for:

Credit Risk: Standardised or IRB approach (APS 112/113)

Market Risk: Standardised approach or IMA (APS 116)

Operational Risk: Standardised Measurement Approach (SMA)

Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book (IRRBB): APRA capital add-on

7. Capital Planning & ICAAP

A robust Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) includes:

Capital Forecasting: 3–5 year forward-looking projections under baseline and stress scenarios.

Stress Testing: Severe but plausible scenarios (e.g. recession, property price shock, funding stress).

Capital Allocation: Economic capital attribution by business line and risk type.

Recovery Plan: Actions to restore capital if thresholds are breached (e.g., raise equity, cut dividends).

8. Early Warning Triggers

Define trigger levels below Board-approved risk appetite:

Management Buffer Breach: Enhanced monitoring, restrictions on growth.

Recovery Trigger Breach: Activate recovery plan (capital raise, risk-weight optimisation).

Regulatory Minimum Breach: Immediate regulator notification, capital restoration plan.

9. Monitoring & Reporting

Daily/Weekly: CET1 ratio tracking, capital utilisation vs. limits.

Monthly: RWA movements, capital attribution by business.

Quarterly: ICAAP report, stress testing results, Board reporting.

Regulatory: Quarterly APRA ARF_110 returns, annual ICAAP supervisory review (SREP).
