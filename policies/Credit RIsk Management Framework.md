ðŸ“‘ Credit Risk Management Framework
1. Purpose and Scope

This framework defines how the Bank identifies, measures, monitors, and manages credit risk â€” the risk of loss due to a counterparty failing to meet its contractual obligations.
It applies to all portfolios, including Retail, SME, and Corporate, and covers all Australian geographies (NSW, VIC, QLD, WA, SA, TAS, ACT, NT).

The framework aligns with:

APRA APS 220 (Credit Risk Management)

APRA CPS 220 (Risk Management)

ASIC responsible lending obligations

Australian Privacy Principles for customer data

2. Governance Structure

Board Risk Committee (BRC): Approves credit risk appetite, reviews portfolio trends, and concentration exposures quarterly.

CRO: Accountable for credit risk policy, monitoring, and escalation.

Credit Risk Function: Owns risk measurement (ratings, LGD, EAD, RWA) and independent review of underwriting standards.

Business Units: Own origination, servicing, and monitoring within approved limits.

3. Credit Risk Identification & Measurement
Core Risk Metrics
Metric	Definition	Frequency
Credit Rating Distribution	% of exposures in A/B/C/D/E	Monthly
LGD	Expected loss severity given default	Monthly
EAD	Total exposure at default	Monthly
RWA	Risk-weighted assets under APS 112	Monthly
Capital Allocation	Regulatory capital allocated to credit	Monthly
Provision Coverage Ratio	Provisions Ã· total loans	Monthly
Arrears	% loans > 30/90 days past due	Monthly
Concentration Risk Metrics

Concentration risk is measured along the following dimensions using Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) or exposure percentages:

Dimension	Metric	Limit
Single Customer	Exposure Ã· Total Capital	â‰¤ 5%
Industry (ANZSIC)	Max exposure per industry	â‰¤ 20%
Geography	Max exposure per state	â‰¤ 25%
Product Type	Max exposure per product type	â‰¤ 40%
Customer Segment	Max exposure per segment (Retail, SME, Corporate)	â‰¤ 50%

Breaches are escalated and require CRO review and portfolio action (e.g., restrict new lending in breached dimension).

4. Monitoring & Reporting

Monthly Credit Risk Dashboard: Credit rating distribution, LGD trend, EAD growth, provision coverage, and arrears segmented by industry, geography, product, and segment.

Quarterly Concentration Review: Top 10 industries, geographies, and customers by exposure; HHI trend analysis.

Early Warning Triggers: Alerts generated if exposures exceed 90% of dimensional limits.
