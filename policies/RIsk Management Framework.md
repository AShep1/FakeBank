ðŸ“‘ Risk Management Framework
1. Purpose and Scope

This Risk Management Framework (RMF) sets out the principles, structures, and processes by which the Bank identifies, measures, monitors, and manages material risks.
It covers credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, with explicit links to data models and measurable metrics. The RMF applies to all business units, desks, products, and geographies (NSW, VIC, QLD, WA, SA, TAS, ACT, NT).

The RMF is aligned with:

APRA Prudential Standards (APS 220 Credit Risk, APS 210 Liquidity, CPS 220 Risk Management)

ASIC guidance on responsible lending and disclosure

Australian Privacy Principles for handling customer data

2. Governance Structure

Board Risk Committee (BRC) â€“ approves risk appetite, reviews breaches, and monitors aggregate risk profile.

Chief Risk Officer (CRO) â€“ owns the RMF, sets policies, and ensures compliance.

Risk Management Function â€“ independent monitoring, model validation, and escalation.

Business Units / Desks â€“ own day-to-day risk taking within approved limits.

Escalation thresholds, breach reporting, and remediation timelines are documented per risk type.

3. Risk Identification & Measurement

Each material risk is identified and linked to measurable metrics:

Risk Type	Primary Metrics	Frequency	Tools
Credit Risk	Credit rating distribution, LGD, EAD, RWA, provision coverage ratio, single-customer exposure, industry/geography/product exposure	Monthly	Credit data mart (loans, write_offs, credit_events)
Market Risk	VaR, SVaR, Expected Shortfall, Volatility, position concentration	Daily	Risk engine with desk/instrument granularity
Liquidity Risk	LCR, NSFR, cash inflows/outflows, funding source concentration, stress outflow coverage	Monthly & Daily (for LCR)	Liquidity dashboard & cashflow forecasting tool
4. Monitoring & Reporting

Credit Risk Reports: Monthly, segmented by geography, industry, customer segment, product.

Market Risk Reports: Daily desk-level VaR/SVaR, escalated intraday if limits breached.

Liquidity Risk Reports: Monthly LCR/NSFR compliance; daily early-warning triggers if LCR < 115%.

All breaches trigger root-cause analysis and are reported to CRO within 24 hours.

5. Stress Testing & Scenario Analysis

Credit Risk: Simulate rating migrations (2â€“5% migration rate per month) and LGD shocks (up to +20%).

Market Risk: SVaR 99% confidence scenarios, historical replay, and volatility shocks >30%.

Liquidity Risk: 30-day survival horizon under name-specific and market-wide stress.

6. Data & Model Governance

All risk metrics are calculated from auditable, referentially-intact data (per the credit risk data model).

Models for LGD, EAD, and VaR are independently validated annually.

Data quality thresholds: >99% completeness, <1% orphan records.

ðŸŽ¯ Risk Appetite Statement (RAS)

Our risk appetite defines the amount and type of risk the Bank is willing to accept to achieve its strategic objectives, balancing profitability, resilience, and regulatory compliance.

1. Credit Risk Appetite
Metric	Appetite	Escalation Trigger
Maximum Single Customer Exposure	â‰¤ 5% of Total Capital	> 4.5% alerts CRO
Average Credit Rating (Portfolio)	â‰¥ B	10% of loans migrate to C/D/E in 3 months
LGD (Portfolio)	< 40%	LGD rises > 45%
Provision Coverage Ratio	â‰¥ 1.5%	Drops < 1.7%
Industry Concentration	â‰¤ 20% of Total Portfolio per ANZSIC industry	> 18%
Geographic Concentration	â‰¤ 25% per State	> 22%
Product Concentration	â‰¤ 40% per product type	> 38%
2. Market Risk Appetite
Metric	Appetite	Escalation Trigger
Maximum Desk VaR (99%)	â‰¤ AUD 10M	> 90% of limit intraday
SVaR (99%)	â‰¤ AUD 15M	Exceeds limit 3 days in a row
Volatility Threshold	< 20% (desk level)	> 22% sustained
Position Concentration	â‰¤ 10% per instrument	> 9%
3. Liquidity Risk Appetite
Metric	Appetite	Escalation Trigger
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)	â‰¥ 110%	Drops < 115%
Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)	â‰¥ 105%	Drops < 107%
Maximum Single Funding Source	â‰¤ 20%	> 18%
Stress Scenario Coverage	â‰¥ 30 days	Falls < 35 days
4. Breach Management

Immediate Action: Desk/business head notifies CRO within 1 business day.

Corrective Plan: Documented within 5 business days and approved by CRO.

Board Notification: For material breaches (â‰¥ 120% of limit or repeated breach within 30 days).

5. Linkage to Strategy

This RAS supports the Bankâ€™s strategy of prudent growth by:

Ensuring portfolio credit quality remains â‰¥ B on average

Maintaining sufficient liquidity buffers to support customer lending even during market stress

Limiting market risk so trading activity does not compromise capital adequacy
