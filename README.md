# FakeBank: Data Dictionary

This repository contains a synthetic bank dataset (credit, market, liquidity) and metricated policy documents. The table below is a data dictionary summarising the generated Parquet tables in `data/` and the policy documents in `policies/` with links to the expected S3 locations and the authoritative spec in `specs/`.

Notes:
- S3 bucket prefix used by the uploader is s3://fakebankdata/
- Data files are under s3://fakebankdata/data/ and policies under s3://fakebankdata/policies/
- Local spec files live in the `specs/` folder (e.g., `specs/credit_risk.md`).

## How to regenerate data and push to S3

1. Create and activate the virtual environment (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
& .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Generate the synthetic dataset (this creates files under `data/`, `sample/` and `summary/`):

```powershell
python .\generate_fakebank_data.py
```

3. Dry-run upload (lists S3 keys that would be created):

```powershell
python .\upload.py --bucket fakebankdata --dry-run
```

4. Upload to S3 (requires AWS credentials/profile):

```powershell
python .\upload.py --bucket fakebankdata
```

If you'd like the README to include direct clickable HTTP links to S3 objects (e.g., via the AWS console), I can update the S3 object column to include console URLs â€” tell me which AWS region/account you expect so I can construct the links.

If you want additional fields in the dictionary (e.g., row counts, sample sizes, schema previews), say which ones and I'll add them automatically by inspecting generated Parquet files.
