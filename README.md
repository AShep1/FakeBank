# FakeBank: Data Dictionary

This repository contains a synthetic bank dataset (credit, market, liquidity) and metricated policy documents. The table below is a data dictionary summarising the generated Parquet tables in `data/` and the policy documents in `policies/` with links to the expected S3 locations and the authoritative spec in `specs/`.

Notes:
- Public-style object URLs (region us-east-1) are shown in the table below. Base URL used:
	https://fakebankdata.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
- Data files are under https://fakebankdata.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/data/ and policies under https://fakebankdata.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/policies/
- Local spec files live in the `specs/` folder (e.g., `specs/credit_risk.md`).

## How to regenerate data and push to S3

1. Create and activate the virtual environment (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
& .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Generate the synthetic dataset (this creates files under `data/`, `sample/` and `summary/`):

```powershell
python .\generate_fakebank_data.py
```

3. Dry-run upload (lists S3 keys that would be created):

```powershell
python .\upload.py --bucket fakebankdata --dry-run
```

4. Upload to S3 (requires AWS credentials/profile):

```powershell
python .\upload.py --bucket fakebankdata
```

If you'd like the README to include direct clickable HTTP links to S3 objects (e.g., via the AWS console), I can update the S3 object column to include console URLs â€” tell me which AWS region/account you expect so I can construct the links.

## Profiling charts (examples)

Below are a few example profiling charts generated by `generate_fakebank_data.py` and saved to the `summary/` folder. These help visualise the synthetic dataset and are useful to verify trends and distributions quickly.

### Credit Risk
![Total Loan Amounts by Date](summary/total_loan_amounts_by_date.png)
![Stacked Loan Amounts by Industry](summary/loans_by_industry_stacked.png)
![Stacked Loan Amounts by Channel](summary/loans_by_channel_stacked.png)

### Liquidity Risk

### Market Risk

If you want additional fields in the dictionary (e.g., row counts, sample sizes, schema previews), say which ones and I'll add them automatically by inspecting generated Parquet files.
