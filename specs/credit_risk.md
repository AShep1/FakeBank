# Credit Risk Data Model

## Overview
This data model covers the credit risk domain for a hypothetical bank. It consists of 6 tables, each designed to support panel data over 24 months. Each table includes an `as_of_date` column to represent the month-end snapshot. Referential integrity is enforced throughout.

## Tables

## Data Population Guidelines
- For each month-end (`as_of_date`), generate ~100,000 loan records, ensuring customer and loan referential integrity.
- Customer data should be stable, but allow for new customers each month.
- Loan balances should change slightly each month for most customers, with some large movements for a minority.
- Loan applications and write-offs should reference valid customers/loans only.
- Use realistic distributions for credit ratings, LGD, EAD, RWA, capital, provisions, and arrears.
- Ensure no orphan customers (all referenced customers exist).
- Use Faker to generate names, addresses, and other synthetic data.

## Data Population Guidelines for Loan Securities
- Generate securities for a subset of loans, with plausible distribution of security types (e.g., most mortgages have property as security).
- Use Faker for addresses and owner details.
- Ensure referential integrity: all securities reference valid loans.
- Security values should be realistic and may change slightly month-to-month.
- Lien types should reflect typical banking practices (e.g., most are first lien).

---

## Australian Context
- All data and scenarios should reflect the Australian banking market.
- Regulatory references: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).
- Credit ratings, LGD, EAD, RWA, and capital calculations should follow APRA guidelines.
- Loan securities should include common Australian assets (e.g., residential property, commercial property) and lien types as per Australian law.
- Customer segments should reflect Australian demographics and banking products.
- All monetary values in AUD.
- Compliance with Australian privacy and data protection standards.

## Month-on-Month Data Generation Logic

To simulate realistic panel data for credit risk, use the following approach for month-end changes:

### Loan Balances
- For 99% of customers, loan balances should change by a small random percentage (e.g., Â±2%) each month, reflecting regular repayments and interest accruals.
- For 1% of customers, apply a material change (e.g., >20%) to simulate events such as large repayments, drawdowns, or defaults.
- Use a function such as:

```python
import random

def update_balance(balance, is_material=False):
    if is_material:
        # Material change: large movement
        change_pct = random.uniform(-0.5, 0.5)  # -50% to +50%
    else:
        # Small change: regular movement
        change_pct = random.uniform(-0.02, 0.02)  # -2% to +2%
    return round(balance * (1 + change_pct), 2)
```

### PD and LGD Migration
- Each month, Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) ratings should migrate for a small proportion of loans (e.g., 2-5%).
- Migration should follow a plausible transition matrix, with most ratings remaining stable and a small probability of upgrade/downgrade.
- Example logic:

```python
def migrate_rating(current_rating, migration_probs):
    # migration_probs: dict of {new_rating: probability}
    ratings = list(migration_probs.keys())
    probs = list(migration_probs.values())
    return random.choices(ratings, probs)[0]
```

- Use APRA-compliant rating scales and migration probabilities.
- Ensure that changes are reflected in related metrics (EAD, RWA, provisions, etc.).

## Expanded Loan Table Dimensions

Add the following features to the `loans` table for richer credit risk analysis:

- **industry**: ANZSIC industry classification (for business loans)
- **geography**: State, region, postcode (Australian context)
- **product_type**: Mortgage, personal loan, business loan, etc.
- **purpose**: Purchase, refinance, working capital, investment, etc.
- **currency**: AUD (default), but allow for multi-currency if needed

- **total_liabilities**: Total liabilities of the company
- **annual_revenue**: Annual revenue

## Data Population Guidelines (Expanded)
- Populate dimensional features using realistic distributions for the Australian market (e.g., ANZSIC codes, state postcodes).
- Financial metrics should be plausible and consistent with company size, industry, and loan characteristics.
- Use Faker and synthetic logic to generate these features, ensuring referential integrity and realistic relationships.
- Document all new features in the data generation scripts and ensure they are used in credit risk analysis and reporting.
